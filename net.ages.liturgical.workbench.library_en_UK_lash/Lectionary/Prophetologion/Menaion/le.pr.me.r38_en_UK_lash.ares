Let them bring their witnesses and let them be justified, and them hear and let them speak what is true. Be my witnesses, and I too am a witness, says the Lord God, and my servant whom I have chosen; that you may know and believe me, and understand that I AM; before me there was no other God, and after me there will not be. I am God, and apart from me there is none who saves. I have declared and I have saved; I reproved, and there was no strange god among you. You are my witnesses and I am a witness, says the Lord God. Again from the beginning I AM, and there is none who can deliver from my hands; I will make, and who will turn it back? Thus says the Lord God who redeems us, the holy one of Israel."
