leprVE.reading.text = "The mouth of the just distils wisdom, but the tongue of the unjust will perish. The lips of just men distil graces, but the mouth of the ungodly is turned away. Falsified balances are an abomination before the Lord, but a just weight is acceptable to him. Wherever arrogance enters, there too does dishonour; but the mouth of the humble meditates wisdom. The perfection of the upright will guide them, and the overthrow of the rebellious will spoil them. Possessions will profit nothing in a day of wrath, but justice will deliver from death. When a just man dies he has left regret, but the destruction of the ungodly is speedy and brings joy. Justice rightly directs blameless ways, but ungodliness falls in with injustice. The justice of upright men delivers them, but transgressors are caught by their destruction. When a just man has come to his end hope does not perish, but the boast of the ungodly perishes. A just man escapes from a trap, in his stead the ungodly is handed over. In the mouth of the ungodly is a snare for citizens; but the perception of the just is prosperous. By the good things of the just a city prospers, and in the loss of the ungodly there is rejoicing. By the blessing of the upright a city will be exalted, but by the mouth of the ungodly it was overthrown. One lacking in sense sneers at citizens, but a man of prudence brings stillness."
