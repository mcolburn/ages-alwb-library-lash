leprVE.reading.text = "Let my soul rejoice in the Lord; for he has clothed me with a garment of salvation and a tunic of gladness, he has put a mitre on me as on a bridegroom, and he has adorned me as a bride with adornments; and as earth putting forth it flowers and a garden its seeds, so the Lord has made justice and gladness dawn before all the nations. Because of Sion I shall keep silence and because of Jerusalem I shall not rest, until my justice has gone forth like light, while my salvation shall burn like a torch. And nations will see your justice and kings your glory; and one will call your name a new name, which the Lord will name; and you will be a crown of beauty in the Lord's hand, a diadem of kingship in the hand of your God. And you will no longer be called Abandoned, and your land will no longer be called Desert, for you will be called My Will and your land Inhabited; because the Lord has been well pleased with you, and your land will be inhabited. And as young man lives with a virgin, so will your children dwell; and it will be in the way that a bridegroom is glad in his bride, so the Lord will glad at you."
