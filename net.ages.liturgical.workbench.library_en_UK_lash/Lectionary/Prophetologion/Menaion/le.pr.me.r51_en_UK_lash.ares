leprVE.reading.text = "Be enlightened, be enlightened, Jerusalem, for your light has come and the glory of the Lord has dawned upon you. See, darkness will cover the earth as thick darkness upon nations; but upon you will the Lord manifest himself, and his glory will appear upon you. And kings will walk in your light and nations in your splendour. Like up your eyes around and see your children gathered; see, all your sons have come from afar, and your daughters will be raised on menâ€™s shoulders. Then you will see, and fear and be amazed in your heart, because wealth of sea and of nations and of peoples will transfer to you; and herds of camels will come to you and camels of Madiam and Gaipha will cover you; all they from Saba will come, bringing gold and they will bear incense and precious stone and they will declare the good tidings of the salvation of the Lord. And all the sheep of Kedar will be gathered to you and the rams of Nabaioth will come to you, and there will be offered acceptable sacrifices on my altar, and my house of prayer will be glorified. Who are these who fly like clouds and as doves with their nestlings? The isles awaited me and in the first place the ships of Tharsis to bring your children from afar and their silver and gold with them for the sake of the holy name of the Lord and for the sake of the glorious Holy One of Israel. And strangers will build your walls and their kings will stand before you; for because of my wrath I smote you and because of mercy I loved you. And your gates will be open continually, night and day they will not be shut, to bring to you the power of the nations and their kings as captives; for the nations and kings who will not serve you will perish and the nations will be made a desert in the desert places. And the glory of Libanus will come to you with cypress and pine and cedar together, to glorify my holy place and I shall glorify the place of my feet. And the sons of those who humbled you and of those who embittered you will come to you afraid, and you will be called City of the Lord, Sion of the Holy One of Israel. Because of your being abandoned and hated, and there was no one to help you, I will give you eternal joy, gladness for generations of generations; and you will suck the milk of nations and eat the wealth of kings; and you will know that it is I the Lord who save you and I the God of Israel who deliver you."
