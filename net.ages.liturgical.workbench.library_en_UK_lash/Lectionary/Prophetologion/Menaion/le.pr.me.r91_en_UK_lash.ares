leprVE.reading.text="A child has been born for us, a son has been given to us; whose government is upon his shoulder, and his name will be called \"Angel of Great Counsel, Wonderful Counsellor, Mighty God, Potentate, Prince of Peace, Father of the age to come.\" For I will bring peace upon princes, peace and health to him. Great his government, and of his peace there is no bound, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to establish it, and to uphold it with judgement and with justice from henceforth and for ever more. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this."
