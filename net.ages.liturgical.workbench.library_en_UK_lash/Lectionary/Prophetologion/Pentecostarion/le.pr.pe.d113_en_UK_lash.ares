And I spoke to you at that time saying: I shall not be able to bear you alone. The Lord your God has multiplied you, and behold, you are today as the stars of heaven in multitude. May the Lord the God of our fathers multiply you a thousand times more than you are, and bless you as He has spoken to you. And I took from you wise and understanding and prudent men, and I set them to rule over you, captains of thousands and hundreds and fifties and tens and recorders for your judges. And I commanded your judges at that time, saying: Hear cases between your brethren, and judge rightly between a man and his brother and the proselyte who is with him. You shall not have respect to persons in judging. You shall hear the small as well as the great. You shall not shrink before any man's person; for the judgement is God's."
