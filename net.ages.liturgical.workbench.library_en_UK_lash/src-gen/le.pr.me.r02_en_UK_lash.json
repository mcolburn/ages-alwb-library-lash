Before time he established me, in the beginning before he made the earth. And before he made the deeps and before the springs of waters came forth, before the mountains were set firm and before all the hills he begets me. The Lord made countries and uninhabited places and the high inhabited parts of the earth under heaven. When he was prepar­ing the heaven I was present with him, and when he marked out his throne on the winds. When he made the clouds on high strong and secured the fountains of the earth under heaven. When he gave his command to the sea — and the waters will not transgress his order —, and when he was strengthening the foundations of the earth, I was by him arranging all things. I was the one in whom he delighted; while day by day I rejoiced in his presence at every moment.'}
