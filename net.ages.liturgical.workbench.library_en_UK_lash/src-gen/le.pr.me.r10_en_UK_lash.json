I fashioned you and I gave you and set you as a covenant to the people, to establish the land, to apportion inheritances for the desolate s; saying to the prisoners, 'Come forth'; to those who are in darkness, 'Reveal yourselves.'  They shall feed along the ways, on all the paths shall be their pasture.  They shall not hunger nor thirst, neither scorching wind nor sun shall smite them, but he who has mercy on them will comfort them, and will lead them through springs of waters.  And I will make every mountain a way, and every path a pasture for them.  See, some shall come from afar, some from the North and from the Sea, and others from the land of the Persians.  Let the heavens rejoice and the earth be glad; let the mountains break out into joy and the hills into justice! For God has had mercy on his people, and has comforted the lowly of his people.  But Sion said, 'The Lord has forsaken me and the Lord has forgotten me.'  Will a woman forget her child, or have no mercy on the offspring of her womb?  Even though a woman may forget, yet I will not forget you, says the Lord Almighty.'}
