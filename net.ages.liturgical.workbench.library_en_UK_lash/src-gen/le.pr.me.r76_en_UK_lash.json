{'id_' : 'le|pr|me|r76_en_UK_lash|leprVE|reading|text', 'text' : 'My son, do not treat lightly the Lord's discipline, nor give up when you are rebuked by him. For the Lord disciplines the one he loves; scourges every child he receives. Blessed the man who has found wisdom, every mortal who knows prudence. For it is better to trade for her than for treasures of gold and silver. She is more precious than valuable stones; nothing evil will withstand her; she is well known to all who draw near her, nothing precious is worthy of her, for length of life and years of life are in her right hand, while in her left are wealth and glory. Justice comes from her mouth; she carries law and mercy on her tongue. Her ways are good ways and all her paths are in peace. She is a tree of life to all who lay hold of her, and to those who lean hard upon her as upon the Lord she is safe.'}
