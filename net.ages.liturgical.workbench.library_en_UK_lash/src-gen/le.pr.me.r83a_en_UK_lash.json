And Jesus approached him and said: 'Are you one of ours? Or are you one of the enemy's?' But he said to him: 'I am Chief Captain of the power of the Lord, and now I have come here'. And Jesus fell on his face to the ground and said: 'Master, what orders have you for your servant?' And the Chief Captain of the Lord said to Jesus: 'Untie the sandals from your feet; for the place where you are standing is holy'; and Jesus did so.'}
