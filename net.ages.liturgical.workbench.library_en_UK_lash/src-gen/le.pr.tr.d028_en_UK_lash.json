And God put a trance upon Adam, and he slept, and he took one of his ribs and filled up the flesh instead of it. And God built the rib which he had taken from Adam into a woman and brought her to Adam. And Adam said: This now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman, because she has been taken from the Man. For this reason a man will leave behind his father and mother and be attached to his wife and they shall be two into one flesh. And they were both naked, Adam and his wife, and they were not ashamed. Now the serpent was more sagacious than all the beasts on the earth which the Lord God had made. And the serpent said to the woman: What is it God said: you are not to eat of any tree of Paradise? And the woman said to the serpent: From the fruit of the trees of Paradise we may eat; but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of Paradise, God said: Do not eat of it, do not even touch it, lest you die. And the serpent said to the woman: By death you will not die; for God knows that on the day that you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be as gods knowing good and evil. And the woman saw that the tree was good to eat and that it was pleasing for the eyes to behold and fair for understanding; and she took of the fruit and ate; and she gave to her husband with her and they ate. And the eyes of the two of them were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made aprons for themselves. And they heard the voice of the Lord God as he walked in Paradise in the afternoon and Adam and his wife hid from the face of the Lord God in the middle of the trees of Paradise. And the Lord God called Adam and said to him: Adam, where are you? And he said to him: I heard your voice as you walked in Paradise, and I was afraid because I was naked, and I hid. And God said to him: Who told you you were naked, unless you have eaten of the tree of which alone I commanded you not to eat? And Adam said: The woman, whom you gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate. And the Lord God said to the woman: Why did you do this? And the woman said: The serpent deceived me, and I ate. And the Lord God said to the serpent: Because you have done this, you are accursed above all the cattle and all the wild beasts of the earth; on your breast and on your belly you will go, and you will eat earth all the days of your life, and I shall place enmity between you and the Woman, and between your seed and her Seed; He will watch for your head, and you will watch for his heel. And to the woman he said: Multiplying I shall multiply your pains and your groaning; in pains you will give birth to children, and your recourse shall be to your husband, and he will lord it over you. While to Adam he said: Because you listened to the voice of your wife, and ate of the tree of which alone I commanded you not eat, you ate of it, the earth is accursed in your works; in pains you will eat all the days of your life; thorns and thistles it will bring up for you, and you shall eat the grass of the field; in the sweat of your brow you shall eat your bread, until you return to the earth from which you were taken; because you are earth and to earth you shall return. And Adam called his wife's name Life; because she is the mother of all the living.'}

With his knowledge the deeps were broken open and the clouds poured down dew. My son, keep my counsel and my thought, do not pour them away, that your soul may live and grace be around your neck; and there shall be health for your flesh and safety for your bones; that with confidence you may walk all your ways in peace, and your foot may not stumble. For if you sit down, you shall be unafraid; if you slumber, you shall have sweet sleep; you shall not fear alarm coming upon you, nor the assaults of the impious; for the Lord shall be over all your ways and shall support your feet, so that you are not snared. Do not hold back from doing good to the needy, whenever your hand is able to help. Do not say, 'Come back again sometime', and 'Tomorrow I shall give': when you are able, do good, for you do not know what the coming day will bring forth. Do not devise evils for your friend who lives near you and trusts you. Do not quarrel with someone needlessly, lest they devise some evil against you. Do not gain the reproaches of wicked men, nor covet their ways; for every transgressor is unclean before the Lord, he does not take his seat among the just. The Lord's curse is on the houses of the ungodly, but the dwellings of the just are blessed. The Lord opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble.'}
