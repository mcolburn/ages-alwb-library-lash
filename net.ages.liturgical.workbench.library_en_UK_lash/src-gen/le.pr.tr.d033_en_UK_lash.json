And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived and gave birth to Enoch. And he was building a city; and he named it with his son's name, Enoch. To Enoch was born Gaïdad; and Gaïdad begot Maleleël; and Maleleël begot Mathousala; and Mathousala begot Lamech. And Lamech took two wives; the name of the one was Ada and the name of the second Sella. And Ada gave birth to Jobel; he was the father of those who dwell in tents and feed cattle; and the name of his brother was Joubal; it was he who revealed psaltery and harp. While Sella too gave birth, to Thobel, and he was a smith, a bronze-smith of bronze and iron; while Thobel's sister was Noëma. Now Lamech said to his wives, Ada and Sella, 'Hear my voice, wives of Lamech, give ear to my words: because I have killed a man to my wounding, and a youth to my bruising. Because it has been revenged on Cain seven times, but on Lamech seventy times seven'. Now Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived and gave birth to a son, and named his name Seth, saying: For God has raised up for me other seed in place of Abel, whom Cain killed. And to Seth there was a son; he named his name Enos; he hoped to call on the name of the Lord God.'}

Let them be for you alone, and let no stranger share with you. Let your source be for you your own, and be glad with the wife of your youth. Let the hart of love and the colt of your graces be your companion, let her be considered your own, and let her be with you at every moment; for living in the company of her love, you will achieve much. Be not much with a strange woman, do not be held in the arms of a woman not your own; for the ways of a man are before the eyes of God, he keeps watch on all his tracks. Iniquities hunt a man; while each one is bound in ropes of his own sins. This man dies with the uninstructed; he has been cast out of the abundance of his own livelihood, and he has perished through folly. My son, if you go surety for your friend, you will entrust your hand to an enemy; for a man's own lips are a strong snare, and he is caught by the lips of his own mouth. Do, my son, what I command you, and be safe.'}

And Seraphim stood around him, the one having six wings and the other having six wings, and with two they covered their faces and with two the feet and with two they flew. And one cried to the other and they said, 'Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord Sabaoth. The whole earth is full of his glory.' The threshold was lifted up at the voice with which they cried, and the house was filled with smoke. And I said, 'Woe is me! For I am pricked to the heart, because I, a human being, and with unclean lips dwell among a people with unclean lips, and with my eyes I have seen the King, the Lord Sabaoth.' And one of the Seraphim was sent to me, and in his hand he held a burning coal, which he had taken with tongs from the altar. And touched my mouth and said, 'See, this has touched your lips and it will take away your iniquities and cleanse your sins.' And I heard the voice of the Lord saying, 'Whom shall I send? And who will go to this people?' And I said, 'See, here am I. Send me.' And he said, 'Go, and say to this people, “You will hear and not understand, and seeing, you will see and not perceive.” For the heart of this people has grown fat, and they have heard with heavy ears and they have shut their eyes, lest perhaps they perceive with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and turn back, and I will heal them.' And I said, 'Until when, Lord?' And he said, 'Until the cities are deserted from being inhabited and the houses from there being no people, and the land will be abandoned as desert. And after this God will remove the people far away, and those who are left behind will be multiplied on the land'.'}
