Assemble and hear me, sons of Jacob. Hear Israel, hear your father. Juda, your brothers shall praise you. Your hand will be on the back of your enemies. Your father's sons will bow down before you. Juda is a lion's whelp. From a tender shoot, my son, you have gone up. He crouches down, he stretches out like a lion, like a whelp. Who will rouse him? A ruler will not fail from Juda, nor a leader from his thighs, until the things laid up for him come, and he is the expectation of the nations. Binding his foal to the vine and his ass's colt to the branch, he will wash his robe in wine and his cloak in the blood of the grape. His eyes are more cheering than wine, and his teeth whiter than milk'.'}

Rejoice and exult with all your heart, daughter of Jerusalem! The Lord has taken away your iniquities, he has ransomed you from the hand of your enemies. The king of Israel, the Lord, is in your midst. You shall see evils no more. At that time the Lord will say to Jerusalem, 'Be of good courage, Sion Do not let your hands grow weak. The Lord, your God, is in your midst. The Mighty One will save you. He will bring joy upon you and renew you by his love. He will rejoice over you with delight, as on a day of festival. And I will gather your afflicted. Alas! Who has taken up a reproach against you? I will work for your sake at that time. And I will save her that was oppressed and receive her who was rejected, and I will make them a boast and famed in all the earth'.'}

He is meek and riding on beast of burden, on a young colt. He will utterly destroy the chariots from Ephraim and the war horse from Jerusalem. And the battle bow he will utterly destroy, and there shall be abundance of peace out of the nations, and he will rule over the waters as far as the sea, and from rivers unto the ends of the earth. As for you also, because of the blood of my covenant with you, I will set your prisoners free from the waterless pit. You shall dwell in your strongholds, prisoners of the congregation. For one day of your exile I will repay you double. For I have bent you Juda as bow for myself. I have filled Ephraim and I will arouse your children, O Sion, against the children of the Greeks, and handle you like a warrior's sword. Then the Lord will appear over them, and he will go forth like a lightning bolt. The Lord Almighty will sound the trumpet and march forth in the tumult of his threat. The Lord Almighty will protect them.'}
