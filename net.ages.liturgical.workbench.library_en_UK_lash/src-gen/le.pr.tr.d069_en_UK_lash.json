And you shall separate the round about, saying: Watch yourselves not to ascend the mountain and to touch any of it; anyone who touches the mountain will die the death. A hand shall not touch it; for with stones he shall be stoned, or with a arrow he shall shot down; whether beast or human, he shall not live. But when the sounds and the trumpets and the cloud depart from the mountain, they shall ascend the mountain. Moses came down from the mountain to the people and hallowed them, and they washed their garments. And he said to the people: Get ready for three days, do not approach a woman. It came to pass on the third day, when it was towards dawn, and there were sounds and lightnings and a dark cloud on mount Sinai, the sound of the trumpet echoed loudly; and all the people in the camp trembled. And Moses led the people to the meeting with God outside the camp, and they took their stand beneath the mountain. The whole of mount Sinai smoked because God had come down upon it in fire, and the smoke went up like the steam from a furnace; and all the people was greatly amazed; and the sounds of the trumpet increased, growing louder and louder. Moses spoke, while God answered him with a sound.'}

Gird your loins like a man, while I shall question you; but you answer me! Where were you when I founded the earth? Tell me, if you possess understanding. Who laid its measures, if you know? Or who drew out a line upon it? On what are its rings fixed? Who is the one who placed a cornerstone upon it? When the stars came into being, all my angels praised me with a loud voice; I fenced the sea with gates, when it was being delivered, coming out of its mother's womb; I placed a cloud for it as clothing, I swaddled it in mist; I placed limits for it, placing bars and gates round it. I said to it: As far as this you shall go, and you shall not go further, but your waves shall break in yourself. Or did I order the morning light in your time? the morning star to see its place, to lay hold on the wings of the earth, to shake off the ungodly from it? Or have you taken earth (and) clay and fashioned a living and speaking being, have you placed him on the earth? Have you taken light from the ungodly, and smashed the arm of the proud? Have you come to the source of the sea, trodden in the steps of the abyss? Do the gates of death open to you in fear, when they saw you did Hell's gate-keepers tremble? Have you been instructed in the breadth of it (the earth) beneath heaven? Tell me, how great is it? In what land does the light pitch camp? What is the place of darkness? If you could bring me to its bounds, if you knew its paths, would you know it because you had been born then, because the number of your years is great? Job answered the Lord and said: I know that you can do all things, while nothing is impossible for you. For who is he that hides counsel from you? Being sparing of words and thinks to hide them from you? Who will declare to me what I did not know, great and wonderful things what I did not understand? Hear me, Lord, and I shall speak; I shall ask you, but do you teach me; I have heard of your report by ear before, but now my eye has seen you.'}

Just as there many will be astonished at you, so your appearance will be without glory from men, and your glory from the sons of men. So many nations will marvel at him; kings shall shut their mouths; for that which had not been told them about him they shall see, and that which they had not heard they shall contemplate. Who has believed what we have heard? And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed? We brought a report as of a child before him, as a root out of dry ground; he had no form or glory, and we saw him, and he had neither form nor beauty. But his form was without honour and inferior to the children of men. He was a man in suffering and acquainted with bearing weakness, because his face has been away, he was dishonoured and not esteemed. He bears our sins and is in pain for us. We reckoned him to be in toil and in affliction and trouble. But he was wounded for our sins and crushed for our iniquities; upon him was the punishment of our peace, and by his bruises we are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray; every one has gone astray in their own way, and the Lord handed him over for our sins. And he, because of his affliction, does not open his mouth; like a sheep he was led to the slaughter, and like a lamb before its shearer is silent, so he does not open his mouth. In his humiliation his judgement was taken away; who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken away from the earth; because of the iniquities of my people he was led to death. And I will give the evil for his burial and the rich for his death, because he practised no iniquity, nor was there guile in his mouth. And the Lord wishes to cleanse him of his blow. If you give an offering for sin, your soul will seed a long-lived descendence. And the Lord wishes to take away from the toil of his soul, to show him light and to fashion him with understanding, to justify the just one, who serves many well, and he will bear their sins. Therefore he will inherit many and divide the spoils of the strong. Because his soul was handed over to death, and was numbered with the transgressors; and he bore the sin of many, and was handed over because of their iniquities. Rejoice, barren one who do not give birth, break out and cry, you who are not in labour, for the children of the desolate are more than those of her that has a husband.'}

But I, like an innocent lamb led to be sacrificed, did not know; against me they devised an evil thought, saying: Come, and let us cast wood into his bread and let us wipe him out of the land of the living, and let his name be remembered no more. Lord, you judge justly, you try reins and hearts, may I see vengeance upon them from you, because I have revealed to you my justification. Therefore thus says the Lord to the men of Anathoth who seek for my life and who say: Do not prophesy in the name of the Lord, otherwise you will die at our hands. See, I shall visit them; their youths will die by the sword, their sons and daughters will perish by hunger, and there will not be a remnant of them; because I shall bring evils upon the inhabitants of Anathoth, in the year of their visitation. You are just, Lord, so I shall make my defence to you, moreover I shall speak of judgements to you: why does the way of the ungodly go well? Those who set breaches of faith at nothing have prospered, you planted them and they have taken root; they begot children and produced fruit; you are near to their mouth and far from their reins. And you, Lord, know me, you have tried my heart before you; purify them for the day of their slaughter. How long will the land grieve and the grass of the field be dried from the wickedness of its inhabitants? Animals and birds have vanished, because they (the inhabitants) said: God will not see our ways. Your feet run and make you faint. Assemble all the beasts of the field and let them come and eat it. Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard, they have defiled my portion, they have made my desired portion a trackless desert, it has been made into utter destruction. Because thus says the Lord of all the evil neighbours who touch my inheritance, which I have apportioned to my people Israel: See, I shall drag them from their land and I shall cast Juda out of their midst. And it shall be that after I have cast them out, I shall turn back and have mercy on them, and I shall make them dwell, each in his inheritance and each in his land.'}
